Task:
There are 3 urns labeled X , Y , and Z .

Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

==>Let's list the combinations that result in sums greater than 9.
   (4,6) (6,4) (5,5) (6,5) (5,6) (6,6)

==>Total no of favourable outcomes = 36 - 6 = 30

==>P(event) = Fav. outcomes/Total outcomes = 30/36 = 5/6

==>Answer = 5/6
