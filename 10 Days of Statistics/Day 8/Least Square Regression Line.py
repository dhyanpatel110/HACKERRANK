# Task:
# The regression line of y on x is 3x+4y+8=0, and the regression line of x on y is 4x+3y+7=0
# What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

regression X:
3x + 4y + 8 = 0
     3x + 8 = -4y
 3x/4 + 8/4 = -y
  -3x/4 - 4 =  y (reverse signal)
         bx = -3/4
    
regression Y:
4x + 3y + 7 = 0
     3y + 7 = -4x
 3y/4 + 7/4 = -x 
-3y/4 - 7/4 =  x (reverse signal)
         by = -3/4

r² = bx * by
r² = -3/4 * -3/4
r² = 9/16
r  = +/- 3/4
if bx = by then
 r = -3/4

Answer: -3/4
