Task:

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. 
Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?


Explination:

==> 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles so total marbles = 7
    first marble drawn is red 1/7
    since already 1 marble is choosen, there are 6 marbles left. We need to pick up the blue marble, where there are 4 blue coloured marbles.
    P(E) = 4/6 = 2/3
    
==> Answer = 2/3
