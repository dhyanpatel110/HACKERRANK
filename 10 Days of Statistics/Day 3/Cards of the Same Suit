Task:
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

Explination:

==> We have 52 options for the first card 13*4 (4 suites)
    There are 13 ways to select a color card out of 52
    Then again if you pick one more card, there are 12 remaining of the same color, out of total 51 remainig cards.
    P(E) = 12/51
    
==> Answer = 12/51
